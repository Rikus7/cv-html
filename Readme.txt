Rikus du Plessis Portfolio

For my Virtual CV I went with a professional design that is innovative and easy to navigate by scrolling
down or by using the navbar to navigate the websites and its different sections.
The website has animations such as the typing section on the home screen and the
fading up of every section as you scroll down or as you select a section on the nav bar.
As well as the moving skills bars. Some features of the website are that you have direct access to my
GitHub through a button as well as a button that makes the user able to download my CV.
There is also a contact section where you can go to my LinkedIn page.
The website showcases who I am, what my interests and skills are. The website consists of HTML,
CSS and JavaScript. It is hosted on GitHub pages and is compatible with all device types.
